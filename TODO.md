## Data user rights

- Still issues when using sync with files generated by non-root docker containers.
  - If I push cms.sqlite, wordpress cannot connect anymore because 755 on sqlite file and not same user ( cannot write ) 
  - Should have a patch-data script ? Ran by sync automatically, which patch before and after transfer ? Or just after ?

## Improve security
- Data should not be 777 ?


## `project-deploy`
- Lock reserved domains
- Forbid `VIRTUAL_HOST` in `environments` in `docker-compose.yaml` somehow
- Forbid `port` `user` etc in docker compose pasta
- Forbid docker-compose.pasta.yaml completely

## Server
- Script to check resources on VPS ( ram / disk ) + send emails ( which platform to use ? )

## `pasta sync`
- Add a way to filter out tmp data
- Add a way to create data filters for sync ( like cms or ugc )


## Proxy
- Progressive weight zero-downtime load balancing ?
